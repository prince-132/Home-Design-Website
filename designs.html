                     <p><b>Save With Stock Items:</b>Custom framing, sewing, upholstering and other skilled labor can add a bundle to the bottom line. Instead, stick with stock items whenever you can: Buy off-the-shelf frames and mats, and trim non-valuable art prints to fit them. Buy standard blinds that are a bit larger than your windows and mount them outside the frames. Snap up stock cabinets and finish them with moldings for a custom look. Order that sofa in a neutral, ready-to-ship fabric and use the money you save to splurge on colorful throw pillows. </p>

                <h1>Good design</h1>
                <p>Good design is functional, beautiful, rational, and socially conscious. We design projects to enhance people's lives. There is great value to coming home and going to work in tranquil environments, void of information overload. Our clients are part of the creative process and an integral member of the design team, which allows our work to go beyond elegant, functional and beautiful, to become meaningful. </p>

                   <p>The dining room as a glamorous but versatile space, Custom banquettes and tea tables occupied the corners of the room, and a console divided the conversation and dining areas and served as a buffet. Upholstery in hues of coral and blue provided an energizing backdrop. </p>

                    <h1>Family Room</h1>
                    <p>The family room was intended as a multipurpose room, the center of family activity. Architectural panels faux-painted by The Valley Craftsmen concealed a doorway and grounded the seating area. Traditionally styled upholstered pieces were generously sized. A coffee table with pull-out stools served various functions, from dining to card playing. </p>
