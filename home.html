                 <p><b>When you know</b> the basic home designingprinciples you can transform any space to look
                    fabulous. You know what it feels like when you walk into a well designed room. You
                    can sense how everything feels cohesive and put together. It feels just right. You
                    can achieve that effect in your own home with a little knowledge of basic design pr
                    inciples. Pair that knowledge with practice and experimentation and you're on your
                    way to creating a beautiful home. </p>

                <h1>Balence</h1>
                <p>In design, balance creates a feeling of equilibrium. It is all about equalizing or approximating the visual weight of objects. Balance is created not just through shape, but through color, pattern, and texture as well. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="rest_1">
                <h1>Rhythm</h1>
                <p>As in music, rhythm in design is all about creating patterns of repetition and contrast to create visual interest. You can achieve this by using the same color or shape at different intervals. Its purpose is to move your eye around the room. For instance, you can establish a rhythm by using a color in the pillows, picking it up in a painting, and echoing it again in a rug. These repetitions will help carry your eye around the room.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="rest_2">
                 <h1>Harmony</h1>
                 <p>Harmony is created when all the elements act together to create a unified message. Just as rhythm can create excitement, harmony creates a sense of restfulness. For instance, you can create harmony by using just one color, even though your forms vary greatly in shape, size and texture. </p>
